	<p><b>I will tell information about W&T</b></p>
	<p>My story has started on February 2016. I was submitted and accepted. I'm going to be a lifeguard and to work at USA. I've bought flight ticket and my visa has been approved. I went to Virginia and worked for 3 months as a lifeguard. Then I've planned my travel. I'd like to go east and west side of America and I did. My return flight was from New York so I've travelled L.A first and then Las Vegas and San Francisco. My last destination was New York. I've visitted so much beautiful place. It was an <i>American Dreaming</i>. <b>If you have dreams then catch them!</b></p>
